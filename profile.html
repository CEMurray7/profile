  <h2>a BIO...Short and Sweet</h2>
<p> Claire began her professional career at the tender age of 15.
  Her first paid job, was working with plants at Fairchild Tropical Gardens,
in Miami, FL. Shortly Thereafter, her career in the Theater field began to
start showing promise.</p>

and had garnered a spot in the Screen Actors Guild. Her education continued after
High School at New World School of the Arts. Claire also simulataneously continued
her education at Miami Dade college, seeking a degree in Hospitality Management.
During this period, her financial success was realized by working in, as well as managing
Nightclubs in Miami Beach.</p>

working in conjunction with Nightclub Management.  The next step, was to seek education in Nursing.
After Nursing school, in 2011, instead of continuing to work in the Nightlife industry as an

specializing in helping Small businesses start to make their mark within the local Miami community.</p>

seeking another degree in Elementary Education, Claire decided to expand her skill set further,
by breaking into the emerging Tech market.  She is currently a student at Wyncode, in Miami Florida.</p>
<p>Besides continuing education in those many fields, Claire has continued to teach herself a number of
other skills as well. Her personal philosophy is based on the fact that there is no such thing as
"useless knowledge".  Current projects include: bathroom and kitchen renovations, cultivating
yeasts and using them in food and beverage, archery, and making the perfect sausages.</p>
